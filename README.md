# 📊 **Study Tracker**

## 📌 **About the Project**
**Study Tracker** is a machine learning–based application that predicts student performance by analyzing daily habits such as **study time, sleep, social media usage, and exercise**.

The goal of this project is to provide **simple insights** into how lifestyle factors affect academic outcomes.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**
1. **Student habit data** is collected and cleaned  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is performed to understand patterns  
3. A **Linear Regression model** predicts academic performance  
4. A **KNN model** estimates the student’s attention level  
5. Results are shown through an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**
